    <section id="gotcha-not-negate">
      <title>NOT and NEGATE</title>
      <para>
        In CG-2 and VISLCG the keyword NOT behaved differently depending on whether it was
        in front of the first test or in front of a linked test. In the case of
        <screen>
          (NOT 1 LSet LINK 1 KSet LINK 1 JSet)
        </screen>
        the NOT would apply last, meaning it would invert the result of the entire chain,
        but in the case of
        <screen>
          (1 LSet LINK NOT 1 KSet LINK 1 JSet)
        </screen>
        it only inverts the result of the immediately following test.
      </para>

      <para>
        CG-3 implements the <link linkend="test-negate">NEGATE</link> keyword to make the distinction clearer.
        This means that if you are converting grammars to CG-3 you must replace starting NOTs with NEGATEs
        to get the same functionality. So the first test should instead be
        <screen>
          (NEGATE 1 LSet LINK 1 KSet LINK 1 JSet)
        </screen>
      </para>

    <section id="gotcha-setop-minus">
      <title>Set Operator -</title>
      <para>
        In CG-2 the - operator means set difference; in VISLCG it means set fail-fast; in CG-3 it means
        set difference again, but the new operator ^ takes place of VISLCG's behavior.

    <section id="gotcha-application-order">
      <title>Rule Application Order</title>
      <para>
        In CG-2 the order in which rules are applied on cohorts cannot be reliably predicted.
      </para>
      <para>
        In VISLCG rules can be forced to be applied in the order they occur in the grammar, but
        VISLCG will try to run all rules on the current cohort before trying next cohort:
        <screen>
          ForEach (Window)
          &nbsp; ForEach (Cohort)
          &nbsp;&nbsp; ForEach (Rule)
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ApplyRule
        </screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        CG-3 always applies rules in the order they occur in the grammar, and will try the current
        rule on all cohorts in the window before moving on to the next rule.
        This yields a far more predictable result and cuts down on the need for many sections in the grammar.
        <screen>
          ForEach (Window)
          &nbsp; ForEach (Rule)
          &nbsp;&nbsp; ForEach (Cohort)
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ApplyRule
        </screen>

      <title>Mappings</title>
      <para>
        The CG-2 spec says that readings in the format
        <screen>
          "word" tag @MAP @MUP ntag @MIP
        </screen>
        should be equivalent to
        <screen>
          "word" tag @MAP
          "word" tag @MUP
          "word" tag ntag @MIP
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        Since the tag order does not matter in CG-3, this is instead equivalent to
        <screen>
          "word" tag ntag @MAP
          "word" tag ntag @MUP
          "word" tag ntag @MIP
        </screen>
