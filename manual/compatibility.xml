      <title>NOT and NEGATE</title>
      <para>
        In CG-2 and VISLCG the keyword NOT behaved differently depending on whether it was
        in front of the first test or in front of a linked test. In the case of
        <screen>
          (NOT 1 LSet LINK 1 KSet LINK 1 JSet)
        </screen>
        the NOT would apply last, meaning it would invert the result of the entire chain,
        but in the case of
        <screen>
          (1 LSet LINK NOT 1 KSet LINK 1 JSet)
        </screen>
        it only inverts the result of the immediately following test.
      </para>

      <para>
        CG-3 implements the <link linkend="test-negate">NEGATE</link> keyword to make the distinction clearer.
        This means that if you are converting grammars to CG-3 you must replace starting NOTs with NEGATEs
        to get the same functionality. So the first test should instead be
        <screen>
          (NEGATE 1 LSet LINK 1 KSet LINK 1 JSet)
        </screen>
      </para>

    <section id="gotcha-setop-minus">
      <title>Set Operator -</title>
      <para>
        In CG-2 the - operator means set difference; in VISLCG it means set fail-fast; in CG-3 it means
        set difference again, but the new operator ^ takes place of VISLCG's behavior.

      <para>
        The CG-2 spec says that readings in the format
        <screen>
          "word" tag @MAP @MUP ntag @MIP
        </screen>
        should be equivalent to
        <screen>
          "word" tag @MAP
          "word" tag @MUP
          "word" tag ntag @MIP
        </screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        Since the tag order does not matter in CG-3, this is instead equivalent to
        <screen>
          "word" tag ntag @MAP
          "word" tag ntag @MUP
          "word" tag ntag @MIP
        </screen>
