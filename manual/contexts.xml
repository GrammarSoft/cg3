  <section id="test-position">
    <title>Position Element Order</title>
    <para>
      CG-3 is not very strict with how a contextual position looks. Elements such as ** and C can be
      anywhere before or after the offset number, and even the - for negative offsets does not have
      to be near the number.
    </para>
    <para>
      Examples of valid positions:
      <screen>
        *-1
        1**-
        W*2C
        0**&gt;

  <section id="test-number">
    <title>1, 2, 3, etc</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>1</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      A number indicates the topological offset from the rule target or linked cohort that the test should start at. For scanning tests, the sign of the number also influences which direction to scan. Positive numbers both start left and scan towards the left, and negative both start right and scan towards the right.
    </para>
    <screen>
      # Test whether the cohort to the immediate left matches the set N
      (1 N)

      # Test whether the cohort two to the right, or any other cohorts rightwards of that, matches the set V
      (-2* V)
    </screen>
    <para>
      If the offset exceeds the window boundaries, the match proceeds as-if it was against a null cohort. For normal tests this means they automatically fail, and NOT and NEGATE tests will succeed.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="test-absolute">
    <title>@</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>@</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      '@' is the topological absolute position in the window. It is often used to start a test at the beginning of the sentence without having to scan for <code>(-1* &gt;&gt;&gt;)</code> to find it. Positive numbers are offsets from the start of the window, and negative numbers are from the end of the window. Thus '@1' is the first cohort and '@-1' is the last cohort.
    </para>
    <para>
      Special cases combined with window spanning: '@1&lt;' is the first word of the previous window, '@-1&lt;' is the last word of the previous window, '@1&gt;' is the first word of the next window, and '@-1&gt;' is the last word of the next window.
    </para>
    <screen>
      # Test whether the first cohort in the window matches the set N
      (@1 N)

      # Test whether the last cohort in the window is a full stop
      (@-1 ("."))

  <section id="test-careful">
    <title>C</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>C</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      'C' causes the test to be performed in a careful manner, this is it requires that all readings match the set. Normally a test such as <code>(1 N)</code> tests whether any reading matches the set N, but <code>(1C N)</code> requires that all readings match N.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="test-not">
    <title>NOT</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>NOT</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      NOT will invert the result of the immediately following test.
    </para>
    <screen>
      # The following cohort, if it exists, must not match the set N
      (NOT 1 N)
    </screen>
  </section>

  <section id="test-negate">
    <title>NEGATE</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>NEGATE</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      NEGATE is similar to, yet not the same as, NOT. Where NOT will invert the result of only the
      immediately following test, NEGATE will invert the result of the entire LINK'ed chain that follows.
      NEGATE is thus usually used at the beginning of a test.
      <emphasis>
        VISLCG emulated the NEGATE functionality for tests that started with NOT.

    <para>
      '*' and '**' start at the given offset and then continues looking in that direction until they find a match or reach the window boundary. '*' stops at the first cohort that matches the set, regardless of whether that cohort satisfies any linked conditions. '**' searches until it finds a cohort that matches both the set and any linked conditions.
    </para>
    <screen>
      # Find an adjective to the left and check whether that adjective has a noun to the immediate right. Stop at the first adjective.
      (-1* ADJ LINK N)

    <para>
      Like <link linkend="keyword-barrier">BARRIER</link> but performs the test in Careful mode,

      These options allows a test to find matching cohorts in any window currently in the buffer.
      The buffer size can be adjusted with the --num-windows cmdline flag and defaults to 2.
      Meaning, 2 windows on either side of the current one is preserved, so a total of 5 would be in
      the buffer at any time.

      <para>
        The --no-pass-origin (or -o in short form) changes the default mode to not allow passing the origin,
        and defines the origin as the target of the currently active rule.

      <title>No Pass Origin</title>
      <para>
        'O' sets the point of origin to the parent of the contextual test, and disallows itself and all linked
        tests to pass this point of origin. The reason it sets it to the parent is that otherwise there is no
        way to mark the rule's target as the desired origin.

    </indexterm>
    <para>
      Usually a '*' or '**' test scans in only one direction, denoted by the value of the offset;
      if offset is positive it will scan rightwards, and if negative leftwards.
      In CG-3 the magic offset '0' will scan in both directions;
      first one to the left, then one to the right, then two to the left, then two to the right, etc.
      This makes it easy to find the nearest neighbor that matches.
      <emphasis>
        In earlier versions of CG this could be approximated with two seperate rules, and you
        had to scan entirely in one direction, then come back and do the other direction.
      </emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      Caveat: (NOT 0* V) will probably not work as you expect; it will be true if either direction doesn't find set V.
      What you want instead is (NEGATE 0* V) or split into (NOT -1* V) (NOT 1* V).

    <indexterm>
      <primary>B</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      Position modifier 'B' causes the test to look in a bag of tags, which is like a bag of words but with all
      tags. 'B' alone looks for tags in the current window, but can be combined with the
      <link linkend="test-spanning">window spanning modifiers</link> to also test the windows before and/or after.
      Linking from a 'B' test behaves as if you linked from offset 0.
    </para>
    <para>
      The bag is greedy and lazy. It will hold all tags added to the window at any time, but will not forget
      tags as they are removed from the window through various means.

    </indexterm>
    <para>
      Position modifer 'f' creates two branches based on the current test. In the first, the test remains exactly as
      is written. In the second, all <link linkend="numerical-matches">numeric tags</link> are removed and
      modifier 'C' is added. This is equivalent to making an inline template with OR'ed tests.
    </para>
    <para>
      E.g., test <code>(-1*f (N &lt;W>50&gt;))</code> is equivalent to <code>(-1* (N &lt;W>50&gt;)) OR (-1*C (N))</code>.
      This is all done at compile time.
      The numeric tag removal will dig down through the whole target set and create new sets along the way as needed.
