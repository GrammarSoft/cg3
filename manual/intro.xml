      This document describes the design, features, implementation, usability, etc
      of an evolution in the <glossterm linkend="gloss-cg">constraint grammar</glossterm> formalism,
      as developed by <glossterm linkend="gloss-visl">VISL</glossterm>.

      I have called this version of CG "VISL CG-3" since it is made by VISL and is a
      general update of the grammar format and parser features that warrants a version bump.
      VISL CG-3 is feature-wise backwards compatible with CG-2 and VISLCG, and contains switches
      to enforce their respective behavior in certain areas.

      Even before any other designing and development had started, the desire to include
      <glossterm linkend="gloss-unicode">Unicode</glossterm> support was a strong requirement.
      By default, grammar file, input stream, and output stream are considered to be
      in ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) encoding as this covers most the grammars and tool
      chains currently written. Internally and through switches there is full support
      for Unicode and any other encoding known by the Unicode library.
      I have chosen the <glossterm linkend="gloss-icu">International Components for Unicode</glossterm>
      library as it provides strong <glossterm linkend="gloss-cross-platform">cross-platform</glossterm>
      Unicode support with built-in regular expressions.
