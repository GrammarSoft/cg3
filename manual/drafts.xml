      Used for tracing and debugging, it will not alter the readings but will gather
      information on why it matched, specifically what cohorts that fulfilled the tests.
      Those numbers will be output in a format yet to be determined. Something along the
      lines of M:548:1,3,4;2,1;9,9 where the numbers are absolute offsets within the window,
      first cohort being the 1st one (0th cohort is the magic &gt;&gt;&gt;).
      As such, 1,3,4 would denote that the first contextual test looked at
      cohorts 1, 3, and 4 to validate itself, but not at cohort 2 (this can easily
      happen if you have a (2 ADV LINK 1 V) test or similar). This reveals a great deal
      about how the rule works.

      These rules will allow you to mark named anchors and jump to them based on a context.
      In this manner you can skip or repeat certain rules. JUMP will jump to a location in
      the grammar and run rules from there till the end (or another JUMP which sends it to
      a different location), while EXECUTE will run rules in between the two provided ANCHORs
      and then return to normal.
