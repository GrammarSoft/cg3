  <title>Input Stream Commands</title>

  <para>
    These are commands that exist in the input stream. They must be alone and at the beginning
    of the line to be respected. They will also be passed along to the output stream.
  </para>

  <section id="cmd-exit">
    <title>Exit</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Exit</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      When encountered, this command will halt input. No further input will be read,
      no output will be written, and the existing buffers will be silently discarded.
      After that, the process will exit. If you were considering using Exit, take a look
      at whether Ignore would suit your needs better.
      <emphasis>It is strongly recommended to precede an Exit with a Flush.</emphasis>
    </para>

      &lt;STREAMCMD:EXIT&gt;

  <section id="cmd-flush">
    <title>Flush</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Flush</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      When encountered, this command will process all windows in the current buffer before continuing.
      This means that any window spanning contextual tests would not be able to see beyond a
      FLUSH point.
    </para>
    <screen>
      &lt;STREAMCMD:FLUSH&gt;
    </screen>
  </section>

  <section id="cmd-ignore">
    <title>Ignore</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Ignore</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      When encountered, this command will cause all subsequent input to be passed along to the output
      stream without any disambiguation, until it finds a Resume command. Useful for excluding parts
      of the input if it differs in e.g. genre or language.
      <emphasis>It is strongly recommended to precede an Ignore with a Flush.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <screen>
      &lt;STREAMCMD:IGNORE&gt;
    </screen>

  <section id="cmd-resume">
    <title>Resume</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>Resume</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      When encountered, this command resume disambiguation. If disambiguation is already in progress,
      it has no effect.
    </para>
