  <title>Constraint Grammar Glossary</title>

  <para>
    The terms in this glossary are specific to the workings and concepts of constraint grammar;
    internal and otherwise.

    <title>Baseform</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>baseform</primary>
      <seealso>wordform</seealso>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      The first part of a reading. Every reading must have one of these. It is usually the
      base form of the word in the containing cohort. Other than that, it is a tag like any other.

  <section id="cg-cohort">
    <title>Cohort</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>contextual target</primary>
      <secondary>target</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      The part of a dependency rule that locates a suitable cohort to attach to.
      It is no different from a normal contextual test and can have links, barriers, etc.
      <emphasis>
        While you technically can NEGATE the entire contextual target,
        it is probably not a good idea to do so.

    </indexterm>
    <para>
      The part of a disambiguation rule that looks at words surrounding the active cohort.
      A rule will not act unless all its contextual tests are satisfied.

    <title>Disambiguation Window</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>disambiguation window</primary>
      <secondary>window</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      An array of cohorts as provided by the input stream. Usually the last cohort in a window is
      one from the DELIMITERS definition.
      CG-3 can keep several windows in memory
      at any time in order to fascilitate cross-window scanning from contextual tests. It is also
      possible to break a window into smaller windows on-the-fly with a DELIMIT rule.

      <seealso>MAP</seealso>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      A special type of tag, as defined by the mapping prefix.
      If a reading contains more than one mapping tag, the reading is multiplied
      into several readings with one of the mapping tags each and all the normal tags copied.
    </para>

  <section id="cg-mapping-prefix">
    <title>Mapping Prefix</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>mapping prefix</primary>
      <secondary>prefix</secondary>
    </indexterm>
    <para>
      A single unicode character. If a tag begins with this character, it is considered a mapping tag.
      The character can be changed with the grammar keyword MAPPING-PREFIX or the command line flag
      --prefix. Defaults to @.
    </para>

    <title>Reading</title>

    </indexterm>
    <para>
      Part of a cohort. Defines one variant of the word in question.
      A reading must begin with a baseform.
      Readings are the whole
      basis for how CG operates; they are what we disambiguate between and test against.
      The goal is to exit with one per cohort.
