      <title>How far will a <code>(*-1C A)</code> test scan?</title>
      
      <para>
        The CG-2 spec dictates that for a test <code>(*-1C A)</code>:
        "There is a cohort to the left containing a reading which has a tag belonging to the set A.
        The <emphasis>first such cohort</emphasis> must have a tag belonging to the set A in all its readings."
        ...meaning scanning stops at the first A regardless of whether it is carefully A.
        To scan further than the first A you must use **.
      </para>
      <para>
        VISLCG2 was not compliant with that and would scan until it found a "careful A".
        This caused the need for ugly hacks such as <code>(*1C A BARRIER A)</code> to emulate the correct behavior.

    <section id="faq-matching-asterisk">
      <title>How can I match the tag <code>*</code> from my input?</title>
      
      <para>
        You can't. The single <code>*</code> symbol is reserved for many special meanings in CG-3.
        I suggest replacing it with <code>**</code> or <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> or anything that isn't
        a single <code>*</code> if you need to work with it in CG.

      <title>Determining whether a cohort has (un)ambiguous base forms</title>
      
      <para>
        If you for whatever reason need to determine whether a cohort has readings with (un)ambiguous base forms,
        the following is how:
      </para>
      <screen>
        LIST bform = ".*"r ;
        
        # Determines ambiguous base forms
        ADD (@baseform-diff) $$bform (0 (*) - $$bform) ;
        
        # ...so NEGATE to determine unambigious base forms
        ADD (@baseform-same) $$bform (NEGATE 0 (*) - $$bform) ;
      </screen>
