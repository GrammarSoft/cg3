  <title>Making use of Relations</title>

  <para>
    CG-3 can also work with generic relations. These are analogous to dependency relations,
	but can have any name, overlap, are directional, and can point to multiple cohorts.

      SETRELATION creates a one-way named relation from the current cohort to the found cohort.

      and one the other way. The names can be the same if so desired.

    <title>Contextual Tests</title>
    <para>
      Once you have relations to work with,
      you can use that in subsequent contextual tests as seen below.
      These positions can be combined with the window spanning options.

      <para>
        The 'r:rel' position asks for cohorts found via the 'rel' relation.
		'rel' can be any name previously given via
		<link linkend="rel-setrelation">SETRELATION or SETRELATIONS</link>.
		Be aware that for combining positional options, 'r:rel' should be the last in the position;
		'r:' will eat anything following it until it meets a space.
