  <para>
    Firstly, the CG-2 optional seperation keywords IF and TARGET are completely ignored by VISL CG-3,
    so only use them for readability. The definitions are given in the following format:
    <screen>
      KEYWORD &lt;required_element&gt; [optional_element]
    </screen>
  </para>

  <section id="delimit">
    <title>DELIMIT</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>DELIMIT</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <screen>
      [wordform] DELIMIT &lt;target&gt; [contextual_tests]
    </screen>
    <para>
      This will work as an on-the-fly sentence (disambiguation window) delimiter.
      When a reading matches a DELIMIT rule's context it will cut off all subsequent
      cohorts in the current window immediately restart disambiguating with the new
      window size. This is not and must not be used as a substitute for the DELIMITERS
      list, but can be useful for cases where the delimiter has to be decided from context.

    <title>Named Rules</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>rule name</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>named rules</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <screen>
      [wordform] MAP:rule_name &lt;tag&gt; &lt;target&gt; [contextual_tests]
      [wordform] SELECT:rule_name &lt;target&gt; [contextual_tests]
    </screen>
    <para>
      In certain cases you may want to name a rule to be able to refer to the same
      rule across grammar revisions, as otherwise the rule line number may change.
      It is optional to name rules, and names do not have to be unique which makes it easier to group
      rules for statistics or tracing purposes.
      The name of a rule is used in tracing and debug output in addition to the line number.
