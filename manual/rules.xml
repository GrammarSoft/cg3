  <title>Rules</title>

  <para>
    Firstly, the CG-2 optional seperation keywords IF and TARGET are completely ignored by VISL CG-3,
    so only use them for readability. The definitions are given in the following format:
    <screen>
      KEYWORD &lt;required_element&gt; [optional_element] ;
    </screen>
  </para>

  <section id="delimit">
    <title>DELIMIT</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>DELIMIT</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <screen>
      [wordform] DELIMIT &lt;target&gt; [contextual_tests] ;
    </screen>
    <para>
      This will work as an on-the-fly sentence (disambiguation window) delimiter.
      When a reading matches a DELIMIT rule's context it will cut off all subsequent
      cohorts in the current window immediately restart disambiguating with the new
      window size. This is not and must not be used as a substitute for the DELIMITERS
      list, but can be useful for cases where the delimiter has to be decided from context.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="substitute">
    <title>SUBSTITUTE</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>SUBSTITUTE</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <screen>
      [wordform] SUBSTITUTE &lt;locate tags&gt; &lt;replacement tags&gt; &lt;target&gt; [contextual_tests] ;
    </screen>
    <para>
      This works as in VISLCG, but the replacement tags may be the * tag to signify a nil replacement,
      allowing for clean removal of tags in a reading. For example, to remove TAG do:
    </para>
    <screen>
      SUBSTITUTE (TAG) (*) TARGET (TAG) ;
    </screen>
  </section>

  <section id="named-rules">
    <title>Named Rules</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>rule name</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>named rules</primary>
    </indexterm>
    <screen>
      [wordform] MAP:rule_name &lt;tag&gt; &lt;target&gt; [contextual_tests] ;
      [wordform] SELECT:rule_name &lt;target&gt; [contextual_tests] ;
    </screen>
    <para>
      In certain cases you may want to name a rule to be able to refer to the same
      rule across grammar revisions, as otherwise the rule line number may change.
      It is optional to name rules, and names do not have to be unique which makes it easier to group
      rules for statistics or tracing purposes.
      The name of a rule is used in tracing and debug output in addition to the line number.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="rule-options">
    <title>Rule Options</title>
    <para>
      Rules can have options that affect their behavior.
      Multiple options can be combined per rule and the order is not important, just seperate them with space.
    </para>
    <screen>
      # Remove readings with (unwanted) even if it is the last reading.
      REMOVE UNSAFE (unwanted) ;

      # Attach daughter to mother, even if doing so would cause a loop.
      SETPARENT ALLOWLOOP (daughter) TO (-1* (mother)) ;
    </screen>

    <section id="rule-options-nearest">
      <title>NEAREST</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>NEAREST</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for rules SETPARENT and SETCHILD.
        Not compatible with option ALLOWLOOP.
      </para>
      <para>
        Normally, if SETPARENT or SETCHILD cannot attach because doing so would cause a loop, they will seek
        onwards from that position until a valid target is found that does not cause a loop.
        Setting NEAREST forces them to stop at the first found candidate.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-allowloop">
      <title>ALLOWLOOP</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>ALLOWLOOP</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for rules SETPARENT and SETCHILD.
        Not compatible with option NEAREST.
      </para>
      <para>
        Normally, SETPARENT and SETCHILD cannot attach if doing so would cause a loop.
        Setting ALLOWLOOP forces the attachment even in such a case.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-delayed">
      <title>DELAYED</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>DELAYED</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for rules SELECT, REMOVE, and IFF.
        Not compatible with option IMMEDIATE.
      </para>
      <para>
        Option DELAYED causes readings that otherwise would have been put in the deleted buffer to be put in
        a special delayed buffer, in the grey zone between living and dead.
      </para>
      <para>
        Delayed readings can be looked at by contextual tests of rules that have option LOOKDELAYED,
        or if the contextual test has position 'd'.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-immediate">
      <title>IMMEDIATE</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>IMMEDIATE</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for rules SELECT, REMOVE, and IFF.
        Not compatible with option DELAYED.
      </para>
      <para>
        Option IMMEDIATE causes readings that otherwise would have been put in the special delayed buffer to be put in
        the delayed buffer. This is mainly used to selectively override a global DELAYED flag
        as rules are by default immediate.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-lookdelayed">
      <title>LOOKDELAYED</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>LOOKDELAYED</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
      </para>
      <para>
        Option LOOKDELAYED puts <link linkend="test-deleted-delayed">contextual position 'd'</link> on all tests done by that rule,
        allowing them all to see delayed readings.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-lookdeleted">
      <title>LOOKDELETED</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>LOOKDELETED</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
      </para>
      <para>
        Option LOOKDELETED puts <link linkend="test-deleted-deleted">contextual position 'D'</link> on all tests done by that rule,
        allowing them all to see deleted readings.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-unsafe">
      <title>UNSAFE</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>UNSAFE</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for rules REMOVE and IFF.
        Not compatible with option SAFE.
      </para>
      <para>
        Normally, REMOVE and IFF cannot remove the last reading of a cohort.
        Setting option UNSAFE allows them to do so.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-safe">
      <title>SAFE</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>SAFE</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for rules REMOVE and IFF.
        Not compatible with option UNSAFE.
      </para>
      <para>
        SAFE prevents REMOVE and IFF from removing the last reading of a cohort.
        Mainly used to selectively override global --unsafe mode.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-rememberx">
      <title>REMEMBERX</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>REMEMBERX</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
        Not compatible with option RESETX.
      </para>
      <para>
        Makes the contextual option X carry over to subsequent tests in the rule, as opposed to resetting itself
        to the rule's target per test. Useful for complex jumps with the X and x options.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-resetx">
      <title>RESETX</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>RESETX</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
        Not compatible with option REMEMBERX.
      </para>
      <para>
        Default behavior.
        Resets the mark for contextual option x to the rule's target on each test.
        Used to counter a global REMEMBERX.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-keeporder">
      <title>KEEPORDER</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>KEEPORDER</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
        Not compatible with option VARYORDER.
      </para>
      <para>
        Prevents the re-ordering of contextual tests.
        Useful in cases where a unifying set is not in the target of the rule.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-varyorder">
      <title>VARYORDER</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>VARYORDER</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
        Not compatible with option KEEPORDER.
      </para>
      <para>
        Allows the re-ordering of contextual tests.
        Used to selectively override a global KEEPORDER flag as test order is by default fluid.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-encl-inner">
      <title>ENCL_INNER</title>
      <indexterm>

      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
        Not compatible with other ENCL_* options.
      </para>
      <para>
        Rules with ENCL_INNER will only be run inside the currently active parantheses enclosure.
        If the current window has no enclosures, the rule will not be run.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-encl-outer">
      <title>ENCL_OUTER</title>
      <indexterm>
        <primary>ENCL_OUTER</primary>
      </indexterm>
      <para>
        Applicable for all rules.
        Not compatible with other ENCL_* options.
      </para>
      <para>
        Rules with ENCL_OUTER will only be run outside the currently active parentheses enclosure.
        Previously expanded enclosures will be seen as outside on subsequent runs.
        If the current window has no enclosures, the rule will be run as normal.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="rule-options-encl-final">
      <title>ENCL_FINAL</title>
      <indexterm>

        Applicable for all rules.
        Not compatible with other ENCL_* options.
      </para>
      <para>
        Rules with ENCL_FINAL will only be run once all parentheses enclosures have been expanded.
        If the current window has no enclosures, the rule will be run as normal.
