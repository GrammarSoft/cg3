New features:
- Raw regex tags in the form //r, //i, and //ri. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#regex-icase for details.
- Contextual position cc for any descendent. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/dependencies.html#dep-ct-descendents
- Contextual tests for left/right and leftmost/rightmost children, descendents, or relations. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/dependencies.html#dep-ct-leftof

Changes:
- Endless loop detection and breaking added. If over 1000 iterations on a section occurs for a window, it will try to break the cycle and continue to next section.
- Deprecations of conversions from test C to ALL and NOT to NONE will now error out to prepare for next release, where I will add in the behavior where e.g. ALL cC requires all children to carefully match. Please check that all your grammars compile and fix them if they don't.
- Add/Set/RemRelations now allow the number of relations to and from the contextual target to differ.

Fixed Bugs:
- Fixed data loss bug when Delimit was used together with parentheses enclosures.
- Fixed AddCohort to add an internal invisible reading when otherwise used without explicit readings, so rules can target such empty cohorts.
- Fixed a RemCohort crash bug.
- Fixed test NONE p to work as expected.
- Fixed unification of sets in a mapping context to eliminate sequential duplicate tags.

Other:
- Now uses Boost 1.49.0
- Now uses ICU 49.1.1
