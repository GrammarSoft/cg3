Big new feature is parenthesis handling. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/parentheses.html for details, which also has 4 new reserved keywords PARENTHESES, _LEFT_, _RIGHT_, and _PAREN_.

Other new features:
-- The --sections parameter now takes lists and ranges of sections to run, enabling users to skip sections. Documentation at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/sections.html#sections-range

Changes:
-- On Win32, renamed cg_proc.exe and cg_comp.exe to be cg-proc.exe and cg-comp.exe in order to keep wrapper scripts compatible across platforms. Not even sure why I had underscores in the first place.
-- Now parses and stores ANCHOR, JUMP, and EXECUTE, but they are not yet used by the grammar; will have that functionality in next release.
-- Added mirror of core files at http://groups.google.com/group/constraint-grammar/files

Documentation changes:
-- Added command line reference http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/cmdreference.html
