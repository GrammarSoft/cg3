A new release of VISL CG-3 has been tagged v0.9.2.3279, and with plenty of changes.
Main site: http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html
Source snapshots available at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/download/vislcg3/ .

Changes since last:

## New grammar parser
The grammar parser has been rewritten from ground up, which has eliminated a lot of bugs.
Sadly has not made it much faster yet (only about 10% improvement so far), but it is a much cleaner design so easier for me to work with and optimize.
It is also far stricter with syntax correctness of grammars; expect to have to fix your syntax if you've been sloppy. I will make it even more strict in the future, with explanatory comments on what was wrong where.

It can now also detect when you create duplicate sets and will warn you about such (won't crash since they are fairly harmless).

The old parser is available with --old-parser , but it will be removed once the new parser has been verified as being the better.

## Set Unification

## Ability to not run parts of the grammar

http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/runtimeoptions.html#rto-no-after-sections

## Binary grammar version bumped
Due to the implementation of Set Unification, binary grammar version has been bumped and older grammars will no longer load.

## Stability improvements on all platforms, inc 64bit
I have run all the CG-3 tests through the most rigorous setting of Valgrind possible, and it has nothing to complain about on any platform I have access to. That's not to say it can't crash, but in my tests there are no more memory leaks or questionable code left.
This includes 64bit platforms, though specifically tested on Fedora 8 x86_64.

## Automatic update script for Linux
- http://anonymous:anonymous@beta.visl.sdu.dk/svn/visl/tools/vislcg3/trunk/scripts/auto-linux-wget.sh
If your platform has wget, ICU libraries, and GNU GCC C++ compiler, this script will download, compile, and run regression tests on the latest version from the repository.

...and that's all for this batch.
