G'day to all on the CG-3 list, and hope you've entered 2008 in good spirits.

A fresh batch of work has been done on the CG-3 project, and I recommend everyone update to latest revision.
I have also made source snapshots available at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/download/vislcg3/ for those without Subversion access.

Bullet points:

- Most significantly, VISL CG-3 now supports binary grammars for improved loading speed and distribution security.
See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/binarygrammar.html for more information.
Using this feature, it is possible to use VISL CG-3 in production as it eliminates the parsing overhead.

- The --statistics flag now generates more detailed and more accurate statistics, plus output files will now be reusable grammars instead of the old garbled inline format.

- Several grammar consistency checks have been added to catch malformed grammars a bit better.
