A new release of CG-3 has been tagged v1.4.5 (binary rev 13897).

Haven't made done one of these rundowns since last NoDaLiDa workshop in 2019, and didn't quite make it in time for last week's NoDaLiDa.

Authoritative repository is now on Github: https://github.com/GrammarSoft/cg3

Notable new features:
- Nested rules keyword With implemented by Daniel Glen Swanson. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#with
- Implemented code coverage / profiling to find annotated examples. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/profiling.html

New features:
- Added rule flags NoMapped and NoParent which will cause the rule to skip mapped readings or cohorts with a dependency parent.
- Cmdline flag --dep-absolute will cause dependency to be written with globally unique cohort IDs
- Added rule flags Ignored that will make Remove hide away readings for the current grammar. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#rule-options-ignored
- RemCohort can take Ignored to hide away whole cohorts. And Ignored WithChild to hide away whole dependency sub-trees.
- Added rule flag LookIgnored and context modifier 'I' to allow rules and contexts to look at ignored readings.
- Added rule type Restore to revive previously deleted/ignored readings. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#restore
- Section headers can now have rule flags, which will then apply to all rules in that section.
- Cmdline flag -B will inhibit and trim whitespace between/after cohorts.
- Cmdline flag -T will delimit based on a regex of non-CG data. Defaults to /(^|\n)<s/. See also https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/cgkeywords.html#keyword-text-delimiters
- Environment variables CG3_DEFAULT and CG3_OVERRIDE can set and override CG-3 cmdline parameters. Ditto CG3_CONV_DEFAULT and CG3_CONV_OVERRIDE for cg-conv.
- Added context modifier 't' to look at non-target readings, and 'T' to only look at target readings. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/contexts.html#test-active
- Added global option addcohort-attach to make all AddCohort rules automatically attach to the nearest neighbour. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/grammar.html#grammar-options
- cg-sort can now sort by weight (-w), reverse (-r), and keep only the first reading (-1).
- cg-conv can now convert back to FST format with -F.
- List += can append tags to an existing set.
- New directive Undef-Sets to delete sets and allow their redefinition. Mostly used when including a common grammar that you want to make a few exceptions to.
- Implemented window-local stream variables. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#local-variables
- Cmdline flag --nrules and --nrules-v to filter which named rules to include in the parse.
- Tag type line match to match the literal whole reading line. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#line-match

Changes:
- Jump targets can now be constructed from unification and varstrings.
- Relation queries can now be constructed from varstrings.
- Relations now exist as tags during the run so they can be captured with regex.
- Relation queries themselves can also be captured with regex.
- Binary grammars should now be reproducible.
- Baseforms may now be empty strings.
- SetVariable/RemVariable now allow varstrings for variable names and values.
- Stream variables can now have their values tested by equality and regex. See https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#global-variables
- Lots of updates and new features to the Emacs mode by Kevin Brubeck Unhammer.
- On Posix platforms, Include paths are now shell-expanded so tilde and environment variables can be used.
- Codebase now requires C++17

Fixed Bugs:
- Shorthand @< and @> will now fail if there is no previous/next window to look at.
