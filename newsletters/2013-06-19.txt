Windows binary is at http://visl.sdu.dk/download/vislcg3/vislcg3-0.9.8.9063-win32.zip

New features:
- Tags on the word form line after the word form are now allowed and may be seen by non-careful contexts. Such static tags cannot be modified. The T_BasicContextTest test has an example of their use.
- cg-conv is a whole new beast with more format conversions. See http://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/cmdreference.html#cg-conv for details.

Changes:
- Traced output is merged if only the mapping tag differs.
- CG-3 now tries to parse past errors in order to show more errors in the IDE.
- STREAMCMD:FLUSH now clears all stream variables.
- Before-Sections, Section, etc are now optional. Any rule declared before any section is declared are assumed to belong to Before-Sections.
- Duplicate tags now survive by default.
- AddCohort and Append now have compile-time sanity checks to make sure they won't blow up.
- Barrier and CBarrier now have sanity checks to make sure they are used in a scanning context.

Fixed Bugs:
- SetParent/Child will no longer apply if a barrier triggered during context resolution. This fixes cases where a ** test would seek onwards past a barrier due to the retry nature of SetParent/Child.
- Vertical Tab (\v, U+000B, ^K) now counts as a line break.
- Creating a varstring from literal $1 now realizes it worked, even though the result remains the same.
- Parent-or-Self tests (pS) now work.
- Many fixes for sub-readings.

Other:
- I consider file suffix .cg3 standard for textual grammars, and .cg3b standard for binary grammars.
