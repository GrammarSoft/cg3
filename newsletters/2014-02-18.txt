New features:
- Kevin Brubeck Unhammer has updated the Emacs mode to have IDE-like features.
- Added option --dry-run to simulate a run. Useful with --trace.
- Substitute can now replace word forms.
- UTF BOMs in input and grammar streams will now be discarded.
- COPY now has an EXCEPT clause.

Changes:
- Duplicate tags now survive by default. Added option --unique-tags to return to the old behavior.
- Inline templates with superfluous () around will now warn.
- Binary grammar feature version is now tracked separately from the main revision, so that only actual feature changes will prevent older CG-3 from loading grammars.
- Building now requires at least CMake 2.8.0.
- Building now uses C++11 if available.
- The C library libcg3 now knows about sub-readings and can more optimally copy a window.

Fixed Bugs:
- Fixed segfault when tracing removed cohorts with dependency.
- Fix parsing composite tags with space after opening (.
- If a test does not succeed, discard any captures performed by that test.
- Rem- and AddCohort now properly updates the endtag marker <<<.
- RemCohort now hands off enclosed cohorts.
