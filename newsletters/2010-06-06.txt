Optimizations:
- Almost doubled processing speed since last release; 176 cohorts per second, up from 95 cohorts per second in 0.9.7.5729. Numbers can be seen on http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3_performance.html
- Cut memory usage by almost half.
- Automatic conversion of LIST with failfast tags to SET Positive - Negative.

New Features:
- Implemented separate literal string modifier "i" as the documentation ( http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#literal-string-modifiers ) had promised for years but wasn't actually able to work without modifier "r" until now.
- DELIMITERS and SOFT-DELIMITERS can now contain and operate with any tag, not just wordforms.

Bug Fixes:
- Made <STREAMCMD:FLUSH> actually forcefully flush instead of merely hinting its desire to do so...
- Fixed IFF rules causing endless loops.
- Fixed &&unification to actually work as advertised.
- Fixed cmdline flag -I to not open and wait for stdin when going through cg3-autobin.pl.

Other:
- Windows binaries now link against ICU 4.4.1.

Also, Kevin Donnelly wrote a nice beginner's tutorial which is available from http://kevindonnelly.org.uk/2010/05/constraint-grammar-tutorial/
