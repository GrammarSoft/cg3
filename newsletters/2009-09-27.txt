Deprecation:
- For dependencies and relations, it is currently allowed to write "cC (tag)" meaning you want all children to have (tag). You should instead now write "ALL c (tag)". Similarly, "NOT c (tag)" should be rewritten to be "NONE c (tag)". A warning is thrown showing you which positions must be changed.
In future versions of CG-3, "cC (tag)" will change meaning to allow constructs such as "ALL cC (tag)" demanding that all readings of all children must match (tag).

New Features:
- Relations can now be created and referred to in a manner similar to dependencies. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/relations.html for more information.
- Variable Strings, allowing you to map/add/replace/append/substitute with tags created on the fly from grouping regular expressions in the condition or target. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#variable-strings for more information.
- New cmdline option --dep-no-crossing which will prevent the creation of dependencies if those would cause the tree to have crossing branches. This can be countered by marking the rule ALLOWCROSS. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#rule-options-allowcross
- New cmdline option --ordered which will allow multiple identical tags to survive in the output. This is work-in-progress to a full order-matters mode.

Optimization:
- Removed a reading-level index, resulting in a rough 20% speed boost.
- Minor other improvements and slightly lower memory usage.

Changes:
- Cohorts no longer remember the position of text that was mixed between its readings; it is now all appended and output together after all the cohort's readings.
- SETPARENT/CHILD/RELATION now mark their touched readings as visible, so magic readings touched by these will be output.
- Deep dependency scans now detect and break on endless loops.
- Tightened some assumptions about which tags are textual. Previously any tags starting with " or < was considered textual; it now checksfor the matching " or > at the end of the tag.
- Unification should now be considerably more predictable when dealing with complex sets and multiple unification sets in a single rule.
- Tracing the relation rules will output which relation they are responsible for in the form of SETRELATIONS(rel,ler):1234:name

Bug Fixed:
- Fixed a few more segfaults to do with dependency handling.
