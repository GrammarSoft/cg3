A new release of CG-3 has been tagged v1.5.0 (binary rev 13898).

Since last release, the VISL parent-project was shut down by the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). URLs thusly changed from visl.sdu.dk to edu.visl.dk.

New features:
- `CMDARGS` and `CMDARGS-OVERRIDE` for setting command line arguments in the grammar. See https://edu.visl.dk/cg3/chunked/grammar.html#grammar-cmdargs
- Cmdline arg `--debug-rules` takes a range of rule line numbers, and will print the windows when a targeted rule tries to do anything.
- Cmdline arg `--print-ids` to always print globally unique cohort ID.
- Numeric tags can do math. Undocumented. `See test/T_NumericalTags/grammar.cg3` and `src/MathParser.hpp`.
- New rule type `CopyCohort` to copy a cohort. See https://edu.visl.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#copycohort
- New rule type `RemParent` to orphan a cohort. See https://edu.visl.dk/cg3/chunked/dependencies.html#dep-remparent
- New rule type `SwitchParent` sets the grandparent of the target as its parent and sets the target as the parent of the previous parent. See https://edu.visl.dk/cg3/chunked/dependencies.html#dep-switchparent

Changes:
- `MergeCohorts` now inherits dependencies and relations by default. See https://edu.visl.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#mergecohorts
- `Substitute (*) ...` can now be used to insert tags without removing any.

Fixed Bugs:
- Reworked how enclosed/deleted/ignored cohorts were stored, fixing several bugs wrt. moving or deleting cohorts that had text or other cohorts attached to them.
- Several fixes wrt. `With` nested rules.
