New features:
- Context test pp for ancestors, analogous to cc. See http://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/dependencies.html#dep-ct-ancestors
- Set/RemVariable now takes rule option OUTPUT to commit a variable to the stream. See http://visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#rule-options-output
- Barriers now work for c* tests
- Sub-reading search with /* will now search all sub-readings. This is currently a very expensive operation.
- Modifiers i, r, ri now work on rule wordforms
- Added cmdline flag --min-binary-revision to programatically determine if a grammar needs rebuilding

Changes:
- CMake project building changed to fit Linux distro packaging
- Now requires CMake 2.8.9+ due to the above
- Now requires Boost 1.48.0+ due to using flat containers
- Greatly optimized the performance of large sets of composite tags
- Reduced memory usage and other performance optimizations

Fixed Bugs:
- Fixed context S to actually test self, even if offset is non-zero
- Fixed handling of readings with multiple mappings and sub-readings
- Fixed negative absolute context offset a'la @-2 to actually work
- Fixed Substituted wordforms not updating the valid rules list
- Fixed setting parent to 0 and later testing for parent
