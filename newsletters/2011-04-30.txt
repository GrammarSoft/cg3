New features:
- New rule type ADDCOHORT that adds a cohort to the window. Documented at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#addcohort
- New rule type COPY that makes a copy of a reading and appends tags. Documented at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#copy
- New rule type UNMAP that removes all mapping tags for the matching reading. Documented at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#unmap
- New rule option UNMAPLAST that removes the last mapping tag from a reading instead of the whole reading. Documented at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#rule-options-unmaplast
- Varstrings can now be used to generate varstrings based on regex and unification with prefix VSTR:.
- Varstrings can also be used to generate set matching with prefix SET:.
- To help with that, keyword STATIC-SETS was added where you can give a list of set names that need to be visible at runtime (default behavior is that set names are stripped).
- Added two new set operators to perform Symmetric Difference and Intersection. Documented at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/sets.html#set-operators
- Emacs: Kevin Unhammer added a cg-goto-rule command to the extension.

Changes:
- Binary grammar version bumped. Grammars from before r6770 are incompatible.
- There can now be multiple rules per line. This is especially useful for those who Include multiple grammars with rules.
- NEGATE, NOT, NONE, ALL may now be used with templates as position overrides.
- Speed is 30% faster than previous release. Memory usage is 12% lower than previous release. If you build with Boost and TCMalloc it will be another 15% faster.

Fixed Bugs:
- Parsing inline sets that were identical to named sets would rename the latter, causing errors.
