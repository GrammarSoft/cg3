New features:
- All tag lists for rules that use them can now be sets and unified &&sets or $$sets. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#taglists-sets for details.
- Varstring tags are now much more powerful. You can now mix in {$$sets} and {&&sets} for inline replacement, and varstrings can now be used in contextual tests. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#variable-strings for details.

Changes:
- Binary grammar version bumped. All old grammars are incompatible. Work-in-progress on getting a stable format...
- Numeric tags (e.g. <key:1234>) are now considered textual as well as numeric. This may subtly alter behavior and be a bit slower, but is necessary for the new varstring handling.
