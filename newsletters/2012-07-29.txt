New features:
- --dep-delimit cmdline flag to enable the use of dependency as delimiters. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/dependencies.html#dep-delimit
- Relations are now pipable and can thus be referenced in later CG-3 processes. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/relations.html#rel-input

Changes:
- The previous release's deprecation of C-to-ALL and NOT-to-NONE conversion has been actualized, so now it is valid to write e.g. ALL cC (ADJ) to require that all readings of all children match ADJ.

Other:
- Bumped minor version to 8, since these changes were important steps towards 1.0.
- Now uses Boost 1.50.0
