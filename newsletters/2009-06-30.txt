Optimizations:
- All the platforms building with GCC 4.3.0 or newer will benefit from std::tr1::unordered_map and std::tr1::unordered_set which yields a 15% faster execution speed than previous GCC version's __gnu_cxx::hash_map.
- Windows build is now made with _SECURE_SCL disabled, which yields 15-35% faster execution speed.
- Parsing grammars is at least 15% faster even without above capabilties, due to cleanup of parsing algorithm.
- Disambiguation is similarly at least 2% faster, due to change of subset matching algorithm.
- Done a full Valgrind memory check and fixed all found leaks (were only minor ones).

Changes:
- Compilation is now with -Wextra for the fun of it. GCC 4.4.0 and newer may complain about not checking return value of a lot of functions, but I'm ignoring those for now...
- Windows binary is now built with ICU 4.2.0.1.
- Now builds and installs cleanly on FreeBSD 7.2.
- Source has been considerably cleaned up by removing the Recycler class and cleaning up what is included where. Still a bit of work to be done, though.
- Position overridden templates now also allow overriding the first BARRIER and CBARRIER, plus they will by default have no-pass-origin enabled. Documentation is currently missing for this.

Bug fixes:
- Position overridden templates now work in both directions.
