Optimizations:
- 20% faster since last release; 224 cohorts per second, up from 176 cohorts per second in 0.9.7.6010.
- Cut memory usage by 30%.
- Numbers can be seen on http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3_performance.html

New Features:
- Implemented cmdline flags --rules and --rule which can be used to run a select range of rules or a single rule.
- Implemented REMCOHORT which completely removes a cohort and all its readings from the window. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#remcohort
- Implemented MOVE and SWITCH to re-arrange cohorts on-the-fly. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#move-switch for how to use them. See the source test/T_Movement for example behavior.
- Now handles Unicode arrows for dependency. E.g. #1->2 and #1â†’2 are the same. Cmdline flag --unicode-tags makes output use Unicode tags.
- Implemented rule flags ITERATE and NOITERATE. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#rule-options-iterate
- Soft-Delimiters now look back once the threshold has been reached, and will delimit the window at the last found soft-delimiter tag (if any exist).
- Implemented using sets for MAP/ADD/REPLACE/APPEND and Relation rules where previously a tag list was required. This means you can do things like MAP $$same TheTarget (-1* $$same) and have the mapping tag be chosen based on context.
- Now allows composite tags in inline sets.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed IFF sometimes removing all readings.
- Allowed extra baseform-like tags to be output. Previously, only the first baseform-like tag was output.

Other:
- Binary grammars version has been bumped. Old binary grammars will need to be recompiled.
- Windows binaries now link against ICU 4.5.1.
- Compiling from source will now use TCMalloc if available; this yields roughly 10% speed boost.
