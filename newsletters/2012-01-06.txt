Ubuntu 11.10 package is at http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/download/vislcg3/CG3-0.9.7.7823-Linux.deb

New features:
- Implemented flow control. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#flow-control
- Implemented sub-readings. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/subreadings.html
- Implemented global variables. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#global-variables and http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/rules.html#setvariable and http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/streamcmds.html#cmd-setvar
- Added special tag _ENCL_ and set _ENCL_ which only matches when on a cohort that has a hidden enclosure attached to it. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/parentheses.html#parentheses-tag-encl
- APPEND may now add multiple readings. Each baseform in the tag list opens a new reading.

Changes:
- Now warns if a tag looks like a set operator. This is useful for those times where you've written LIST but almost certainly meant SET.
- Grammar parsing is 8% faster, but makes assumptions about what whitespace is.
- vislcg3 is now silent unless -v is enabled.
- get-boost.sh now fetches Boost 1.48.0
- Windows binary is now compiled with ICU 4.8.1 and Boost 1.48.0
- Ubuntu 11.10 deb package provided thanks to CMake's CPack.

Fixed Bugs:
- Fixed using External sometimes skipping subsequent rules.
- Removing all cohorts from a window now outputs any text attached to those cohorts, as it should.

Other:
- Added an ANTLR BNF grammar for the CG-3 grammar to help others correctly parse the grammar files. File is cg3.g in the source root.
