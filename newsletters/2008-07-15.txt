Bug fixes:
- Fixed compilation and execution on Mac G5.
- Fixed out-of-bounds error.
- Fixed handling of mappings. One side effect is that duplicate readings may be removed, and some readings may be split when tracing. See http://groups.google.com/group/constraint-grammar/t/a73f8f87285ce354
- Fixed running AFTER-SECTIONS when defined out of order.

Changes:
- Will no longer allow multiple MAPPING-PREFIX to be defined in the grammar.
- Documented that literal string modifiers will not work for wordforms when used as the first qualifier in a rule. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/tags.html#literal-string-modifiers

...and I see Francis Tyers has made some changes to the Apertium tools, but I'll let him explain those.
