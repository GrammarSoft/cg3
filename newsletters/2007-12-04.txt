G'day all on the CG-3 list...

VISL CG-3 has undergone some optimizations and stability improvements, 
plus a few tweaks to actual behavior vs. expected behavior. Everyone is 
strongly encouraged to update to latest version, especially if you have 
experienced any crashes or segfaults before.

Main page: http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html

On the changelog from the last week is:

- CG-3 now auto-detects codepage from environment. Can override with runtime option -C.
- 20-40% application speed increase in all normal circumstances, compared against existing VISL CG-2 and older CG-3.
(sorry, no grammar parsing improvement yet)
--- If compiled with a recent GCC (4.1 or better) you can expect another 5%.
--- In some rare cases you can see a factor 50 speed increase. Should in no cases be slower, though.
- Memory fragmentation greatly reduced.
--- The grammar parser used to allocate and deallocate over 3 GiB memory parsing big grammars. This is cut down to 50 MiB.
--- Dynamic indexes used during application grew to enormous sizes in certain cases; this should no longer happen.
- Several memory leaks fixed.
--- Tested with Valgrind on full detail. There are no known leaks in CG-3 at this time.

Documentation updated in these places:

Also, I was planning on implementing a nearest-neighbor type of scan, 
but appears I had already done it back in March.
So, to be sure people know it exists:
