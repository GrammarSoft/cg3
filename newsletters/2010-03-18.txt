Optimizations:
- Parsing grammars is now 50% faster. This drastically narrows the gap between textual and binary grammars to a mere twice as fast (down from 10x faster).
- Applying grammars is 2% faster, mainly due to I/O related optimizations. For grammars with very few rules this is upwards 20% faster, but can't expect more than 2%.

New Features:
- Set Unification (prefix &&) which unifies at a set level, as a counterpart to $$ which does at tag level. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/sets.html#set-unification
- New contextual position A which marks the cohort that should be attached to. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/contexts.html#test-mark-attach-to
- New sets _TARGET_, _MARK_, and _ATTACHTO_ which only match if the current cohort is the target, X, or A respectively. See http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/sets.html#set-target
- Allowed linking from NOT tests, by stating that it should fail when the cohort to be linked from doesn't exist.
- New cmdline flag --trace-encl to debug enclosure levels.
- New cmdline flag -e, --show-end-tags that allows the <<< tags to appear in output.
- New tool cg-conv to convert from VISL to Apertium format on-the-fly.
- Emacs: Kevin B. Unhammer added a major mode for syntax highlighting of CG-3 files in Emacs. Look in the emacs/ folder in the trunk.

Changes:
- Windows: Updated project files to MSVC++ 2010
- Windows: Upgraded ICU to 4.4.0
- Auto-generate baseforms from wordforms when they're missing. Is linked to magic readings, so can be disabled with --no-magic-readings
- Renamed prefix $$ to Tag Unification since && is more deserving of the Set Unification name.
- Made tag lists for MAP, ADD, REPLACE, APPEND, SUBSTITUTE respect tags with spaces in them.

Bug fixes:
- Fix --ordered to disallow duplicate mapping tags.
- Fixed bug where barriers for overridden templates where not saved in binary format.
- Fix enclosures bug where cohort numbers would get mixed up and match in bizarre manners.
