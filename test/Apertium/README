This is a sub-directory for tests relating to CG integration
with Apertium.

It contains almost the same tests as the parent directory with
the main CG tests, but leaves some out.

==Exceptions==

T_BasicDepedency 
 
  Apertium currently cannot encode dependency information in
  its stream format.

T_DependencyLoops

  see T_BasicDependency

T_DependencyOutOfRange

  see T_BasicDependency

T_InputCommands

  Apertium does not make use of the input commands used to 
  stop, start and flush the stream.

T_InputMarkup

  see new test T_SuperBlanks for test of dealing with markup
  in the stream.

T_NumericalTags
 
  Numerical tags are not valid in Apertium streams.

T_Relations

  No way of expressing this in Apertium streams.

T_SetParentChild

  see T_BasicDepedency

T_SoftDelimiters

  Not currently supported

T_Trace

  Not currently supported -- unlikely to be.

T_Omniscan

  see T_BasicDependency

==Known bugs==

T_CarefulBarrier

  Tag only gets mapped to the last reading in the Cohort.
