* First Time Install *

 These guidelines are primarily for Linux, but I actually develop on Windows
 using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. These steps will not work under Cygwin,
 but I have successfully compiled and run tests under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

** Installing ICU **

 Only need to do this once, but it must be done unless you already have a recent
 (newer or equal to ICU 3.6) version installed. ICU 3.4 may also work, but is
 considerably slower. Latest info on ICU can be found at http://icu-project.org/

 These steps have been tested on Red Hat Linux 8, Red Hat Linux 9, Fedora Core 3,
 Fedora Core 4, and Fedora Core 5. They may vary for your distribution.

 As root:
 # cd /tmp
 # wget -c --passive 'ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/3.6/icu4c-3_6-src.tgz'
 # tar -zxvf icu4c-3_6-src.tgz
 # cd icu/source/
 # ./runConfigureICU Linux
 # make
 # make install
 # echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
 # ldconfig



** Compiling VISL CG-3 **

 This step requires you have Subversion ( http://subversion.tigris.org/ ) installed.
 Subversion binaries are very likely available for your distribution already;
 try using 'yum install subversion' or 'apt-get install subversion' or whichever
 package manager your distribution uses.

 When there are feature-complete releases of VISL CG-3 I will also be making
 proper tarballs of those.

 As any user in any folder where you can find it again:
 $ svn co --username anonymous --password anonymous http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/svn/visl/tools/vislcg3
 $ cd vislcg3/trunk/
 $ ./compile-linux.sh
 $ ./vislcg3

 If all went well, it should spit out the usage information.

 Note: If any errors or warnings were output by compile.sh, please contact me;
       I strive to make it compile cleanly on every platform.
 
 After it has been compiled, you can run the regression test suite as described below.



* Updating / Upgrading *

** Compiling VISL CG-3 **

 In the same folder you chose above, as the same user:
 $ svn up
 $ ./compile-linux.sh
 $ ./vislcg
 
 
* Regression Testing *

 After successfully compiling the binary, you can run the regression test suite
 with the command:
 $ ./test/runall.pl
 
 This will run a series of tests that should all exit with "Success".
 If a test on your end exits with "Fail", please tar up that tests' folder and
 send it to me alongside any ideas you may have as to why it failed.



* Contributing *

 The anonymous user does not have commit rights, and also cannot access any
 other part of the repository. If you want commit rights to VISL CG-3, just
 tell me...
