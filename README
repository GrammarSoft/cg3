* First Time Install *

** Installing ICU **

 Only need to do this once, but it must be done unless you already have a recent
 (newer or equal to ICU 3.6) version installed. ICU 3.4 will also work, but is
 considerably slower.

 These steps have been tested on Red Hat Linux 8, Red Hat Linux 9, Fedora Core 3,
 Fedora Core 4, and Fedora Core 5. They may vary for your distribution.

 As root:
 # cd /tmp
 # wget -c --passive 'ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/3.6/icu4c-3_6-src.tgz'
 # tar -zxvf icu4c-3_6-src.tgz
 # cd icu/source/
 # ./runConfigureICU Linux
 # make
 # make install
 # echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
 # ldconfig

** Compiling VISL CG-3 **

 This step requires you have Subversion ( http://subversion.tigris.org/ ) installed.
 Subversion binaries are very likely available for your distribution already;
 try using 'yum install subversion' or 'apt-get install subversion' or whichever
 package manager your distribution uses.

 When there are feature-complete releases of VISL CG-3 I will also be making
 proper tarballs of those.

 As any user in any folder where you can find it again:
 $ svn co --username anonymous --password anonymous http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/svn/visl/tools/vislcg3
 $ cd vislcg3/trunk/
 $ ./compile.sh
 $ ./vislcg3

 If all went well, it should spit out the usage information.

 Note: If any errors or warnings were output by compile.sh, please contact me;
       I strive to make it compile cleanly on every platform.



* Updating / Upgrading *

** Compiling VISL CG-3 **

 In the same folder you chose above, as the same user:
 $ svn up
 $ ./compile.sh
 $ ./vislcg



* Contributing *

 The anonymous user does not have commit rights, and also cannot access any
 other part of the repository. If you want commit rights to VISL CG-3, just
 tell me...
