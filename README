[Installing ICU]
Only need to do this once, but it must be done unless you already have a recent
(newer or equal to ICU 3.6) version installed. ICU 3.4 will also work, but is
considerably slower.

These steps have been tested on Red Hat Linux 8, Red Hat Linux 9, Fedora Core 3,
Fedora Core 4, and Fedora Core 5. They may vary for your distribution.

As root:
# cd /tmp
# wget -c --passive 'ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/3.6/icu4c-3_6-src.tgz'
# tar -zxvf icu4c-3_6-src.tgz
# cd icu/source/
# ./runConfigureICU Linux
# make
# make install
# echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
# ldconfig

[Compiling VISL CG-3]
This step requires you have Subversion ( http://subversion.tigris.org/ ) installed.
Subversion binaries are very likely available for your distribution already;
try using 'yum install subversion' or 'apt-get install subversion' or whichever
package manager your distribution uses.

When there are feature-complete releases of VISL CG-3 I will also be making
proper tarballs of those.

As any user in any folder:
$ svn co http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/svn/visl/tools/vislcg3

It will prompt for password for your current user, which you don't have.
Hit enter to make it ask for a username.
Username is 'anonymous' and password is also 'anonymous'

$ cd vislcg3/trunk/
$ ./compile.sh
$ ./vislcg3

If all went well, it should spit out the usage information.

Note: If any errors or warnings were output by compile.sh, please contact me;
      I strive to make it compile cleanly on every platform.
